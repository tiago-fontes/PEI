            <p class="normal-text">It’s very challenging to keep track of the state of multiple vehicles from a fleet. Assurance of good conditions between usages is fundamental for any <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-car-sharing-and-how-does-it-work-4858485" target="_blank">Car Sharing</a> service’s reputation. With RideCare you can monitor a car-sharing fleet in real-time and watch over occurred anomalies. Inside the web application, you have access to a dashboard in which you can check all the past anomalies and the corresponding evolution of the sensorial data before, during, and after its occurrence. Once an anomaly occurs, you will be notified and every information about it at your disposal.</p>

            <p class="normal-text">RideCare takes advantage of  real-time classification algorithms, based on classic Machine Learning methods to detect anomalous situations inside shared vehicles.
                From labelled and unlabelled data, several algorithms from Supervised and Unsupervised Learning paradigms were tested and insights were taken during that extensive exploratory work. Our best algorithm achieved more than <b>97% accuracy</b> on all predictions made, for all scenarios considered*. Additionally, other supervised learning algorithms, which performed well during our research process, are hosted by a cloud application -AlertAI Cloud, allowing alternative predictions for the raw data collections.
                <br>*These results were obtained under controlled capture scenarios, taking into account real environments inside vehicles.</p>
